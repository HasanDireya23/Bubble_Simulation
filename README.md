# Dynamic Liquid Bubbles Simulation Module [Link]https://bubble-simulation-l9gdhymwm-hasans-projects-fb9d78f4.vercel.app

This software module simulates three dynamic liquid bubbles on a web page, featuring collision and interaction behaviors. The bubbles are distinguished by varying colors and demonstrate responsive movement to screen dimensions while maintaining containment within the display area. Additionally, the module incorporates gyroscope responsiveness for intuitive interaction on mobile devices.

## Features:

1. **Dynamic Liquid Bubbles:** Three bubbles are generated with varying colors, representing dynamic liquid entities.

2. **Collision Detection:** The bubbles exhibit collision behavior, reacting appropriately upon colliding with each other.

3. **Responsive Design:** The simulation adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal display and containment within the viewport.

4. **Gyroscope Support:** Gyroscope responsiveness enables intuitive interaction with the bubbles on mobile devices.

5. **User Interaction:** Movement of the bubbles can be controlled either by touch or cursor movement, providing user engagement and control over the simulation.

6. **Collision Impact:** When two bubbles collide, each bubble's size is affected, but they remain separate without overlapping, ensuring realistic behavior.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: Structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: Styling and design of the bubbles and overall appearance.
- JavaScript: Implementation of dynamic behavior, collision detection, and gyroscope responsiveness.
